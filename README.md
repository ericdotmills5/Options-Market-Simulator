# Options Market Simulator

This project uses a variety of statistical inferencing techniques I have learned as well as the binomial options pricing model to simulate an options market.

The simulator utilises the Tkinter python module as a GUI for the user to make decisions.

gui_class.py abstracts the buttons and GUI functionality for the project

random_variable.py randomly calculates the security fluctuations according to a given random variable.

options_pricing.py calculates the fair price of the options according to the Cox Ross Rubinstein options pricing model.

This program will be updated as I complete MATH3975 Financial Derivatives (Advanced)
